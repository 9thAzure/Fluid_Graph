idk why I did this, its sort of obvious.

normally, some of the balls from the weak producer will still be able to go through; The flow reverse, just becomes slow.

If the strong force is significantly strong enough, it will still block the flow, forcing the weak producer to use its restrictive connection exclusively. 
However, this restrictive path still technically has infinite throughput. I would still expect for it to reverse (removing the deleter causes this to occur)

If the weak force is especially weak, the above happens again (though it shouldn't reverse as the restrictive path can handle to throughput)


Basically, a producer should try to force flow through other paths. If it can't, it should start brute forcing its way through the input connections.
However, if it weakens, it should do so drastically.
