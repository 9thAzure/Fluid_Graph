A simple project to investigate how to simulate piped fluids.

### Inspiration
This project was inspired by discussion in the [Mindustry](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry) discord on making flowing fluids more consistent across networks, in which making it akin to the the power graph system (which focuses solely on input/output) might work.
